# ReleaseNotesBot

## Usage
These are the unofficially official docs of the ***Captain's Log***

This project is currently under development.
 - Bug reports and feature inquiries are in Slack channel: `#mojotime-release-notes`
 - If you are not in that Slack channel, you may direct message `@zachbob` or `@Sara Davila`

The Captain's log can only be used inside of its home Mojotech organization where it is installed.
You are more than welcome to attempt to use it outside of the Mojotech organization. If you require it's use outside of the Mojo Organization, you may request it from `@zachbob`.

You may use any of the Captain's Log commands anywhere inside of the Mojotech Organization. If you are using a private channel, you must go into the `channel integrations` and `add an app` called: `Captains Log`.
